# Testing Rest Services

There are a number of endpoints in this application.  The following question needs to be answered:

- When does the application STOP returning Fibonacci numbers in their correct sequence?

There are no automated checks for this application.  Treating the application as a black box, produce appropriate automated checks against the applications interfaces.  Consider that there is more than one interface into the application.

- Use only RestSharp to test the REST interface.
- Use only NUnit as a test harness.
- Ensure that your tests can be executed with an appropriate goal from Maven.
